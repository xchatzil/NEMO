# NEMO
Code for **Efficient Placement of Decomposable Aggregation Functions for Stream Processing over Large Geo-Distributed Topologies**

The repository contains two projects:
1. notebooks: Jupyter notebooks of the local experiments and plots of all evaluation results
2. nebulastream: A fork of the NebulaStream master with the NEMO integration

    - RIPEAtlas.ipynb
        - Experiments on the RIPE Atlas dataset
- Jupyter notebooks with additional plots of conducted experiments:
    - NesDeploymentsEval: Contain the plots for the End-to-end performance evaluation of NEMO in NebulaStream
    - Heatmaps: Contain heatmaps about latency statistics of the implemented approach for the tested topologies

## Python Dependencies 
All required dependencies are specified in notebooks/requirements.txt

## Datasets
All datasets of the topologies and results of our experiments can be found in notebooks/datasets

## NebulaStream
NEMO is currently part of the master branch of NebulaStream: https://github.com/nebulastream/nebulastream

We provide in this repository a fork of NebulaStream with our integration of NEMO. A locally runnable Integration test can be found in nebulastream/nes-core/tests/Integration/NemoIntegrationTest.cpp

For a detailed guide how to run and deploy NebulaStream, we refer to: https://docs.nebula.stream/
